      <h1>Eclipse Foundation Unveils New Cloud Native Java Future with Jakarta EE</h1>
    
  
  <p>Future evolution of Java EE, Jakarta EE stack moves to the Eclipse Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>OTTAWA, April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)</strong> &ndash; The Eclipse Foundation, the platform for open collaboration and innovation, today unveiled the new open source governance model and a “cloud native Java” path forward for Jakarta EE, the new community-led platform created from the contribution of Java EE. In late 2017, Oracle <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/opening-up-ee-update" target="_blank">announced</a> that it was transferring the future of Java EE technologies to the Eclipse Foundation, to make the process of evolving its standards “more agile, flexible and open.”</p>

<p>For many years, Java EE has been the de facto platform for enterprise systems &ndash; offering reliable multi-vendor standards, ubiquitous in datacenters across every industry, and delivering stability and scalability on the back-end of the world’s mission critical applications. With the rapid adoption of cloud architectures, microservices and containers, the technology industry is undergoing a rapid transformation.</p>

<p>“Jakarta EE represents the best way to drive cloud native, mission critical applications and build upon the decades of Java EE experience of real world deployments and developers,“ said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. “The pace of innovation necessary to modernize enterprise systems for cloud-centric use cases requires a new governance model &ndash; a focus on faster release cycles, and supporting an open source, community-driven evolution of the platform. To accelerate this innovation process, Java EE technologies are being moved to the Eclipse Foundation where they will evolve under the Jakarta EE brand.”</p>

<p>The Jakarta EE Working Group has already attracted support from some of the leading technology vendors in the world who work with large installed bases of customers running Java workloads, including Fujitsu, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Payara, Red Hat, SAP and Tomitribe. The group’s initial focuses include cloud-native Java enablement, a new governance model that encourages more innovation and faster release cycles, as well as attracting more new members into the community process.</p>

<h2 id="i-cloud-native-java-enablement">I. Cloud-native Java enablement</h2>

<p>A just-completed <a href="/documents/insights/2018-jakarta-ee-developer-survey.pdf">survey</a> sponsored by the Eclipse Foundation captured responses from over 1,800 Java developers worldwide about new technical capabilities they want enhanced with Jakarta EE. The three most critical areas cited for improvement were better support for microservices, native integration with Kubernetes, Docker, etc. and a faster pace of innovation. The Jakarta EE Working Group aims to offer the massive installed base of Java users new, reliable paths to cloud modernization.
Under its new governance model, the Jakarta EE platform is expected to evolve rapidly, incorporating Java innovations from open source communities like Eclipse MicroProfile into new versions of the platform to help developers create portable cloud-native applications.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cloud native computing based on Kubernetes is driving a wave of innovation in the software industry&rdquo; said Chris Aniszczyk, Chief Technology Officer of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. &ldquo;Jakarta EE has the potential to establish Java as a first class language and platform in this space. Given Java&rsquo;s broad adoption in the enterprise, Jakarta EE can enable millions of developers to build and deploy cloud native applications.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="ii-new-community-driven-open-source-governance-model">II. New community-driven open source governance model</h2>

<p>By following the Eclipse Foundation’s proven open source governance model, Jakarta EE promises faster release and innovation cycles. The Eclipse top-level project managing the Jakarta EE codebase has already committed to two releases in 2018. Specifically, the Jakarta EE Working Group seeks to lower barriers to adoption, develop the community and manage the Jakarta EE brand on behalf of the community. Critical to this approach is the community-based specification process, with everyone encouraged to participate in an open process that more accurately reflect the needs of the wider community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Java enterprise application servers and APIs are among the most important development infrastructure in the world, and are the underlying technology that millions of people use everyday to run their lives.&rdquo; said Bruno Souza, President of SouJava. &ldquo;Jakarta EE is a huge win for the worldwide open source community, that will take control of this fundamental development infrastructure. The challenges posed by distributed systems and cloud native applications require an interactive development process, with frequent releases. Jakarta EE will bring speed and innovation to enterprise software development and developers and companies should join the project and take part in this unique opportunity to shape the future of technology. &ldquo;</p>

<h2 id="iii-get-involved-in-the-jakarta-ee-community">III. Get involved in the Jakarta EE community</h2>

<p>By joining the Jakarta EE Working Group, members can participate in an open process to shape the future of cloud native Java. Members will play a key role in defining Jakarta EE strategic themes and priorities, shape the definition and evolution of the specifications process, gain insights to the technology roadmap and help protect their investments in Java EE.
