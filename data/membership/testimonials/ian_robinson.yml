testimonial: "IBM helped create Java EE and guide it through it its teenage years and Iâ€™m delighted to have helped it now move to its new home at the Eclipse Foundation and new future as Jakarta EE. I look forward to Jakarta EE quickly adopting cloud native technologies from EE-centric communities like Eclipse MicroProfile and becoming the fast-moving platform we all need for Java in the cloud."
