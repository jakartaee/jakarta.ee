testimonial: "Red Hat reaffirms its support for the development of Jakarta EE. We look forward to working with the Eclipse Foundation and the broader Java community to align efforts to drive Enterprise Java forward. The breadth of participation in combination with community governance will help accelerate the evolution of Jakarta EE. We believe that Jakarta EE represents one of the most significant events to have happened to the open source enterprise Java ecosystem since OpenJDK was released."
