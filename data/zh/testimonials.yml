        text: In 20 years working in open source and Java standards I've never seen such a truly diverse and equally shared effort as that required to ship Jakarta EE 8. Source code has been donated, but what emerged is a community that bravely accepts change, innovates open processes and repeatedly choses shared victory over individual success. When we look back in 10 years at all we've accomplished in Jakarta, everyone will agree this was the singular moment in time that shaped our future.

        text: "You absolutely don’t have to be the most brilliant, sophisticated, or advanced person in the world to be a committer, but you do need a lot of passion for the work and for the role. You must be willing to dedicate a lot of time to open source because you really like it and it’s your hobby. That passion will take you a long way. When you work with open source software, you have an advantage, and your customers have an even bigger advantage because you implemented the stack you’re working on and you know the other people involved."

        text: "<p>Getting involved in an open source project is a very good way to solve problems you’re having because Eclipse open source is all about contributions and collaboration. If you have a project that’s not getting appropriate attention, the Eclipse and Jakarta EE community can help you move it forward.</p><p>You can start by doing small stuff. It may seem as though it’s not important, but it very often is. You can grow your knowledge about a project and the processes around it to gain experience and work toward committer status if that’s what you want.</p>"

        text: "The best thing about being a committer on an open source project in an environment such as Jakarta EE is that it’s very different from my daily work. At work, I rarely get feedback from the people who actually use my code, whereas here, I can communicate directly with people and respond to their needs. That's a lot of fun for me. Have the confidence to contribute something. You’ll find that the people working on most open source projects gladly accept every improvement."

Being a committer is a great opportunity to work on projects that are popular, widely used, and make life easier for project communities. Solving the community’s problems is very rewarding. I also enjoy the opportunity to solve a different issue every day because it allows me to have rich experiences in a variety of situations."

There are many ways to contribute, from answering questions on the various project mailing lists to filing issues or creating pull requests. You can influence a project by issuing a patch, having an expert review that patch, and having it committed to a project. The big advantage of being more involved is access to expertise."
