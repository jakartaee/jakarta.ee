It was particularly instrumental in establishing a strong open source community in and around the Java platform. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Project#Project_name'>According to Wikipedia</a> the name was originally selected because it was the meeting room used at Sun Microsystems for the meetings that led to the project creation.</p><p>In February 2018, the Community was welcomed to vote on the new name for Java EE. Almost 7,000 community members voted in our community poll, and <a href='https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2018/02/26/and-the-name-is/'>over 64% voted in favour of Jakarta EE</a>. Read <a href='http://www.tomitribe.com/blog/2018/02/java-ee-to-jakarta-ee/'>Java EE to Jakarta EE</a> which explains the history behind the name selection. The Apache Software Foundation kindly allowed the Eclipse Foundation to resume using that name, after it was retired at Apache in 2011.</p>"

The Eclipse Foundation has a 14 year track record of providing a pragmatic, well understood governance model for all interested parties to collaborate on technology. The Foundation will ensure that the new specifications and development processes for Jakarta EE will be open, vendor-neutral, and provide a level playing field for all participants.</p><p>The Eclipse Foundation Specification Process is under development. It is being led by the Jakarta EE Specification Committee using a transparent process that will include engaging the Community for feedback.</p>"

However, there is a strong commitment by all involved to significantly increase the pace of innovation. We intend to also listen to both the developer community and the enterprise consumers of Jakarta EE technologies to understand what their desires are. Obviously there are trade-offs to be made between things such as stability versus pace of new innovation, but it is the fact these trade-offs are being addressed in an open and inclusive manner that will help drive the success of Jakarta EE.</p>"

We are open to working with other open source foundations that are interested in making the logo available to their eligible projects.</p><p>We require membership in the Working Group because the Jakarta EE Compatibility logo and brand have value to our community and the industry.
