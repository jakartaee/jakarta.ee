The Jakarta EE vendor-neutral community is currently at work to keep the back-end of enterprise java applications running in various industries. Products you may know - such as Jetty, Tomcat, Jersey and Spring - all rely on Jakarta EE technologies.
The [Jakarta EE Compatible products](/compatibility/) are implementing Jakarta EE Platform and profile specifications.

In addition to these products, there are many more that are implementing some of the individual specifications. Apache Tomcat implements four Jakarta EE specifications,
Spring Boot embeds Apache Tomcat, Eclipse Jetty, or Undertow as a runtime.
Eclipse Jetty, the Eclipse IDE, MicroProfile, and other industry frameworks that implement MicroProfile are a good example of technologies that rely on Jakarta EE for their cloud native enterprise Java applications.

Beyond these implementations, the industry is increasingly recognizing that Jakarta EE delivers a combination of strategically important features and functions that is not available in any other Java framework.
