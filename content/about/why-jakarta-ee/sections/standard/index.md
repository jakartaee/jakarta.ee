Jakarta EE is the standard, a set of specifications for enterprise Java application development. It is well-understood and widely accepted because of its stability, portability, and backwards compatibility.

But being the standard does not mean being rigid. Jakarta EE is modular - capable of being adapted to fit different platforms and profiles for different organisations all over the world. Jakarta EE enables you to use the individual specifications independently or together.  Depending on your application type and needs you may choose to utilise the Jakarta EE Platform, Jakarta EE Web Profile or Jakarta EE Core Profile.
