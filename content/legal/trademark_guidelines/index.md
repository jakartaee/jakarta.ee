<p><em>Supplement to the Eclipse Foundation Guidelines for Eclipse Logos & Trademarks Policy for Jakarta EE Marks</em></p>

<p>Version 1.0 - December 11, 2018</p>

<p>This document supplements the Eclipse Foundation <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/logo_guidelines.php">Guidelines for Eclipse Logos & Trademarks
Policy</a> (this Supplement, together with the Eclipse Foundation Guidelines for Eclipse Logos &
Trademarks Policy, collectively, the “Policy”) to address the permitted usage of the Jakarta EE
Marks (as defined below). The Jakarta EE marks include, but are not limited to, the following
names and/or logos: Jakarta EE, Jakarta EE Working Group, Jakarta EE Member, and Jakarta
EE Compatible, (collectively the “Jakarta EE Marks”). A full listing of the Jakarta EE Marks may
be found at: <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/artwork/">https://www.eclipse.org/artwork/</a>. Use of the Jakarta EE Marks must at all times
conform to the Policy.</p>

<p>Use of the Jakarta EE Marks is restricted as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use of the "Jakarta EE Compatible" mark is limited to use in conjunction with Compatible
    Software Products (as defined below) distributed by:
    <ul>
      <li>Participant, Enterprise or Strategic Members of the Jakarta EE WG who are also licensees under the Eclipse Foundation Trademark License; or</li>
      <li>Guest Members of the Jakarta EE WG, if:
        <ul>
          <li>Use of the Jakarta EE Compatible mark is approved unanimously by the Jakarta EE WG Steering Committee; and</li>
          <li>Such Guest Members are also licensees under the Eclipse Foundation Trademark License.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Except as expressly set forth above, the use of the Jakarta EE Compatible mark or any
similar branding using the Jakarta, EE4J, or Eclipse name or mark is not permitted in
conjunction with any software or related services, including Compatible Software
Products.</li>
  <li>Use of the Jakarta EE Marks is permitted by community members under nominative fair
use but cannot be used in conjunction with any software product or service.</li>
  <li>The "Jakarta EE Member” logo can only be used to identify those Strategic, Enterprise,
Participant, and Individual Committer Members that are members of the Jakarta EE
Working Group. Only then-current members of the Jakarta EE Working Group are
authorized to use this logo, and use of the logo must conform to all of the terms of the
Policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>For purposes of this document, “Compatible Software Products” means any products which are
deemed Compatible Implementations of Jakarta EE Profiles as those terms are defined in the
then-current Jakarta EE Specification Process.</p>
<p>To ensure the consistency of the Jakarta EE brand, please see our <a href="/legal/trademark_guidelines/JakartaEE_BrandUsageHandbook_v2.pdf">Brand Usage Handbook</a>. This style guide outlines usage standards to ensure that the Jakarta EE logo is instantly and consistently recognizable however and wherever it is used by Foundation members and the community.</p>
