The Jakarta EE Working Group is launching the Jakarta EE Developer Survey for 2019. This is an annual survey that delivers valuable insight into enterprise and cloud native programming languages, platforms, and infrastructure. As always, the results will be shared with everyone. You can find the insights and key findings from the survey we did in 2018.
