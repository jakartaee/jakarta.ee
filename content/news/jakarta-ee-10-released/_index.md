**BRUSSELS, Belgium – Sep 22, 2022** – [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee), a working group hosted by the Eclipse Foundation, one of the world’s largest open source software foundations, today announced the release of the [Jakarta EE 10 Platform](https://jakarta.ee/release/10/), Web Profile and the new Core Profile specifications. Jakarta EE 10 introduces features for building modernized, simplified, and lightweight cloud native Java applications, delivering a new baseline for the evolution and innovation of enterprise Java technologies under an open, vendor-neutral, community-driven process. 

“This release is the ‘big one’ that plants Jakarta EE firmly in the modern era of microservices and containers,” said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. “The release of Jakarta EE 10 reflects the work of a global community of contributors, with leadership from vendors such as Fujitsu, IBM, Oracle, Payara, and Tomitribe. Jakarta EE has already helped breathe new life into enterprise Java, but with this release it has now delivered key innovations for the cloud native era, which are critical to the future of our industry.” 

Jakarta EE 10 provides new functionality in over 20 component specifications through version updates reflected in the specified APIs. For example:

 Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 4.0, including CDI-Lite enabling build time extensions 
Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.1 standardizes a Java SE Bootstrap API and support for multipart/form-data 
Jakarta Security 3.0 supporting OpenID Connect and new functions in Jakarta Persistence queries and create Jakarta Faces Views With Pure Java 
The Jakarta EE 10 release defines a new profile specification with Jakarta EE Core Profile 10, which defines a multi-vendor platform for modernized and lightweight Java applications and microservices. The new Core Profile provides a subset of Jakarta EE specifications that targets smaller runtimes suitable for microservices development with lightweight runtimes, including a new CDI-Lite specification for building lightweight Jakarta EE applications. CDI-Lite allows a reflection-free programing model that enables compiling to native by providing build compatible extensions.

The Jakarta EE 10 release enables enterprises building modernized cloud native Java applications to:

Develop and deploy Jakarta EE 10 applications on Java SE 11 as well as Java SE 17, the most current LTS release of Java SE
Take advantage of the new features including module system introduced in Java SE 9 and supported in Java SE 11 
Another significant aspect of this release is enabling simplified application development by supporting the broader use of additional annotations. This makes it easier to build modularized applications, and offers improved integration across component APIs. Ultimately, this release helps developers more easily implement applications with modern security requirements and remove deprecated APIs, while also maintaining high levels of compatibility with prior Jakarta EE releases.

In addition to these enhancements, there is a growing list of compatible products to support the already rich ecosystem. For example, Eclipse GlassFish 7, Open Liberty, 22.0.0.10-beta and Wild Fly 27.0.0 are delivering compatible versions today. Members of the Jakarta EE Working Group such as Fujitsu, IBM, Oracle, Payara, Red Hat and Tomitribe are working towards certifying Jakarta EE 10 compatible products. Once the release becomes available, the list of Jakarta EE 10 compatible implementations and products is expected to grow rapidly.

## Quotes from Jakarta EE 10 Working Group Members

### Fujitsu
“Fujitsu is excited about the release of Jakarta EE 10, which is the first innovative release since the ‘jakarta’ namespace was updated. It introduces a lot of new functionalities in more than twenty component specifications. Specifically, several security related updates will accelerate to use Jakarta EE technologies more safely in the enterprise systems with cloud native architecture,” said Shinya Echigo, Head of Application Management Division, Fujitsu. “We are delighted to keep working on Jakarta EE technologies in the Eclipse projects, and will soon support running Jakarta EE 10 applications on Fujitsu Products.”

### IBM
“The release of Jakarta EE 10 is a major leap forward in its evolution as the platform for cloud-native Java innovation. Community collaboration in the open has demonstrated its ability to deliver a strong set of new and updated profiles and specifications.” said Melissa Modjeski, IBM VP of App Platform and Watson AIOps, IBM Automation. “Our development team is currently working on updating Open Liberty to adopt Jakarta EE 10. The Liberty architecture and beta program continue to enable rapid adoption and support of the evolving standards. We are pleased to have Open Liberty capability for Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile and look forward to certifying to the other Jakarta EE 10 profiles soon.”

### Microsoft
“Jakarta EE 10 is a milestone release. It delivers a number of long pending changes vital to moving the ecosystem forward.” said Scott Hunter, Microsoft VP of Product, Azure Developer Experience. “The Jakarta EE Core Profile is especially important in powering next generation cloud native Java runtimes. We look forward to enabling Jakarta EE 10 runtimes in Azure as they become available, collaborating with key partners like Oracle, IBM, Red Hat and VMWare.”

### OmniFish
“As the biggest sponsor to the GlassFish project, OmniFish are very happy and excited by the release of Jakarta EE 10. The importance of this release is hard to underestimate, as it marks the first feature release since Java EE 8 was released 5 years ago and subsequently transferred to the Eclipse Foundation.”Said Arjan Tijms, founder of OmniFish. “Jakarta EE 10 therefore truly marks the beginning of a new era for Jakarta EE. We’re happy to have seen so many different vendors and community members contributing significantly to this release, making it truly a multi-vendor and community project. OmniFish will show its dedication to Jakarta EE by continuing to support GlassFish, and additionally bringing Jakarta EE 10 compatibility to Piranha Cloud, which enables a wider range of users to take advantage of the Jakarta EE APIs.”

### Oracle
“The release of Jakarta EE 10 is great news for Java developers and the Java community,” said Tom Snyder, vice president of Oracle Software Development. “Oracle already supports Jakarta EE 9 APIs in Helidon 3.0 milestone releases, and we are working on Coherence Community Edition support for Helidon and other frameworks that use Jakarta EE 9 APIs. We intend to leverage the new Jakarta EE 10 features across the Oracle Enterprise Cloud Native Java product line in the future to offer new solutions and more value for Java developers.”
