summary = "In this article, we introduce the Eclipse Graphical Language Server Platform (GLSP), a technology to efficiently build diagram editors for web- and cloud-based tools. These diagram editors can run inside an IDE, such as Eclipse Theia or VS Code; or can be used stand-alone in any web application. Eclipse GLSP fills an important gap in the implementation of graphical editors for web-based domain-specific tools. It is an ideal next-generation solution for replacing traditional desktop technologies such as GEF and GMF. Eclipse GLSP is a very active open source project within the Eclipse Cloud Development Tools ecosystem."
