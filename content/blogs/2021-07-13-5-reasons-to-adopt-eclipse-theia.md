Recently I wrote about the momentum happening in the Eclipse Theia project. In this post, I want to highlight some good reasons to adopt Theia as your IDE solution. The core use case for Theia is as a base upon which to build a custom IDE or tool. However, if you are a developer looking for a great tool to use, you will find some motivation here as well. The inspiration for this post comes from Theia project lead Marc Dumais’ ‘Why Use Theia?’ talk that he gave at the recent Cloud DevTools Community Call. So, you could say this is Marc’s post!
