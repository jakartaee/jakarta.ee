The Eclipse Theia project was born just 4 years ago. Kudos and thanks to all the organizations that have supported and built the project into the success that it is today. In addition to these original contributors, there continues to be significant growth in the number of companies contributing to and adopting Theia as the basis for their custom IDEs and domain-specific tools. Because of our active and vibrant community, Theia is now a thriving and diverse project â€” ready to move to the next level of growth and adoption.
