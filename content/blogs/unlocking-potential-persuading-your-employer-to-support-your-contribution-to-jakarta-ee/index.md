As a dedicated employee, you understand the importance of seeking opportunities that contribute to the success of your organisation. One such opportunity lies in actively participating in open source software development.  In particular for enterprise application software engineers, development and maintenance of Jakarta EE, the de facto open source standard for Java-based enterprise applications. In this blog post, we will explore the numerous benefits that arise when employees are encouraged to contribute to Jakarta EE as part of their normal work activities. These compelling arguments will help you convince your employer of the value it brings to your organisation while respecting the demands of your everyday work.

## Nurturing Continuous Professional Growth

By endorsing employee contributions to Jakarta EE as part of normal work activities, your organisation fosters a culture of continuous professional growth. Engaging with the platform's development allows employees to stay up-to-date with cutting-edge technologies, industry trends, and best practices. The knowledge gained through these contributions can be directly applied to their day-to-day work, resulting in improved skills, heightened expertise, and increased efficiency. Emphasising the integration of Jakarta EE contributions within regular work activities ensures that professional growth becomes an organic and ongoing part of your employees' roles.

## Amplifying Organisational Expertise

Supporting employee contributions to Jakarta EE demonstrates your organisation's commitment to becoming an industry leader. Jakarta EE is widely recognized as the de facto standard for Java-based enterprise applications, providing a robust and scalable foundation for software development. By actively participating in Jakarta EE, your employees gain expertise in implementing enterprise solutions based on industry-standard specifications. Additionally, considering that your organisation is likely already using Jakarta EE, either directly or indirectly (for instance via Spring Boot), participating in its development ensures alignment with the technologies and frameworks your organisation relies on. This alignment enhances your organisational expertise and strengthens your position as a trusted authority in the industry. It allows you to fully leverage the capabilities of Jakarta EE, tapping into its vast ecosystem and best practices to drive innovation and deliver high-quality solutions.

## Leveraging a Global Network of Collaboration

Enabling employees to contribute to Jakarta EE as part of normal work activities opens doors to a global network of collaboration. Within the Jakarta EE community, your employees can connect with professionals, experts, and thought leaders from diverse backgrounds and industries. This network provides a platform for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual learning. By leveraging these connections, your organisation gains access to valuable insights, innovative ideas, and potential partnerships that can fuel your growth and competitiveness.

## Influencing the Evolution of Enterprise Java

Encouraging employee contributions to Jakarta EE allows your organisation to have a say in the evolution of enterprise Java. By integrating these contributions into normal work activities, you ensure that your specific needs and priorities are considered when shaping the platform. This influence enables you to align Jakarta EE with your organisational requirements, leading to a more tailored and effective enterprise Java environment. Active participation empowers your employees to contribute their expertise, drive innovation, and positively impact the future of the Java community.

## Conclusion

Persuading your employer to support your contribution to Jakarta EE as part of normal work activities can unlock numerous benefits for your organisation. By nurturing continuous professional growth, amplifying organisational expertise, leveraging collaboration networks, and influencing the evolution of enterprise Java, you demonstrate your dedication to staying at the forefront of Java-based enterprise development. Supporting employee participation in Jakarta EE aligns with your organisation's existing usage of the platform, ensuring that you fully leverage its capabilities, tap into its vast ecosystem, and deliver innovative solutions. By presenting these compelling arguments, you can highlight the value Jakarta EE brings to your organisation while showcasing your commitment to personal and professional growth. Embrace the opportunity to be an active participant in the Jakarta EE community, knowing that your organisation is already benefiting from its usage, and watch as you and your organisation thrive in the dynamic landscape of enterprise Java.
