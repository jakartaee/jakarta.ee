The first ever Cloud IDE Day was held on May 19th, 2021 as a virtual event. While we do have our ongoing Cloud Tool Time webinars and Cloud Chat Twitch.tv series, for the Eclipse Cloud DevTools Working Group, Cloud IDE Day was our first attempt at organizing a larger scale event. With over 200 registrants, nearly 150 live attendees and an impressive group of speakers that delivered some fantastic sessions, you can expect to see more of these kinds of events in the future.
