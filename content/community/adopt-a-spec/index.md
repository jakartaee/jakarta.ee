This program is intended to encourage JUG leaders and members to get involved by adopting a Jakarta EE Specification. The objective is to increase developer level participation in the evolution of the Jakarta EE Specification.

{{< jug-adopters-list >}}  

## How JUG leaders can help:

Ensure that the topic of the adopted Jakarta EE Specification is consistently discussed, e.g. dedicate a portion of the existing JUG meetups to the discussions related to the adopted Specification, arrange monthly calls with all representatives of JUGs that are running the program in their groups. 

## How JUG members can get involved:

* Take part in specification development (API / specification documents / TCK / implementations)
* Write a blog about the Specification and add it on [JakartaBlogs](https://jakartablogs.ee/)
* Promote the Specification on socials e.g. twitter
* Write a full end to end test web application (e.g. Pet Store for Jakarta EE )
* Read the specification and comment on areas it is unclear
* Write more tests above what we already have
  * All the repositories are under the Jakarta EE GitHub Organization: https://github.com/jakartaee
  * Example 1 - Jakarta Servlet: https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet
  * Example 2 - Jakarta Messaging: https://github.com/jakartaee/messaging

## What we can offer to JUGs:

* Promote and provide recognition to JUGs by listing them on the adopted Specification page
* Enable JUGs to have priority for organizing JakartaOne Livestream - local edition (providing framework and tools)
* Enable JUGs to have Jakarta EE release parties (e.g. provide Jakarta EE presentation material and giveaways for one Jakarta EE release party per year)
* Facilitate Adopt-a-Spec activities in the “hackerspace” at EclipseCon
* Arrange “Meet the experts” informal gatherings/tech talks at EclipseCon and other main events
* Opportunity to participate in live code-along sessions on Jakarta EE Livestream events
* Opportunity to participate in meetings with Jakarta EE committees or experts to discuss Jakarta EE related topics

## How to sign up:

To sign up please be ready to provide the following information: name of the Specification you wish to adopt, URL to JUG’s website and JUG logo. Here are steps for creating a Jakarta EE [pull request](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee#contributing).

* Add a colored and a white organization logo to `static/images/spec_adopters`. We expect that all submitted logos to be transparent svg.
* Update the Spec adopters data file `data/spec_adopters.yml`. If your JUG wishes to adopt multiple Specifications, you will need to add your organization's YAML definition to the adopters list of each of the relevant Specification nodes.
* The URL to JUG’s website

\* Note that JUG members are welcome to become contributors and commitors on the Specification project and their [participation agreements](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/wayne-beaton/specification-project-committer-agreements) needs to be handled accordingly.
