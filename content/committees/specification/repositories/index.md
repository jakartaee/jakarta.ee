## GitHub Organizations {#gh-org}

The following GitHub Organizations are used by the Jakarta EE Working Group:

- [Jakarta Specifications](https://github.com/jakartaee/) \
Repositories in the `jakarta` organization are associated with a Jakarta Specification project.
Specifically, repositories for Specificaton Documents, APIs, and TCKs.
No other repositories are allowed in this organization.

- [Jakarta Working Group](https://github.com/jakartaee-wg/) \
Repositories in the `jakartaee-wg` organization are for use by the Jakarta EE Working Group.
These repositories are managed by the Jakarta EE Working Group, and are not governed by the EDP or JESP.
Examples of repositories in this organization are websites, collateral materials, and committee tools and assets.

- [EE4J Projects](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/) \
Repositories in the `eclipse-ee4j` organization are associated with EE4J projects related to Jakarta EE.
Examples of this are tools, examples, demos, tutorials, and implementations of Jakarta EE specifications.
**Note** that there is absolutely no requirement that an implementation must be created by an EE4J project.
