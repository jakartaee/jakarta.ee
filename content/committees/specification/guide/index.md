## Introduction {#intro}

This guide is a step-by-step practical guide to help developers on Jakarta EE Specification projects to navigate the steps of the Jakarta EE Specification Process ([JESP](https://jakarta.ee/about/jesp/)). 
It is meant as a helpful tool, so **if in doubt, alway refer to the [JESP](https://jakarta.ee/about/jesp/) for completeness**. 
Please do not hesitate to contact the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) if you have any questions or comments about anything related to the development of Jakarta EE Specifications.
[JESP](https://jakarta.ee/about/jesp/) is an adoption of the Eclipse Specification Process ([EFSP](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/)).

## Creation Review {#creation}

![Creation Review](JESP_creation-review.png)

* A Jakarta Specification project is created as any other project under the Eclipse Development Process ([EDP](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/)).
* A Jakarta Specification project must be approved by the Specification Committee.
* Read more about [creation reviews](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-reviews-creation) in the EFSP.

### Steps Involved

1. Create a Project Proposal (*).
2. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[creation review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/creation_review_pr_template.md)**.
3. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a creation review.
4. Wait for a successful creation review before proceeding.

(*) It may be a good idea to socialize the idea with the Specification Committee to solicit support before proceeding with the project creation.

## Plan Review {#plan}

![Plan Review](JESP_plan-review.png)

* Each specification project needs to engage in a Plan Review prior to any extensive development effort in support of a new Specification Major or Minor Version. 
* Plan reviews are not required for [Service Releases]({{< ref "#service" >}}).
* Read more about [plan reviews](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-reviews-plan) in the EFSP.

### Steps Involved

1. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[plan review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/plan_review_pr_template.md)**.
2. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a plan review.
3. Wait for a successful plan review before proceeding.

## Release Review {#release}

![Release Review](JESP_release-review.png)

* A final version of a specification cannot be made generally available until after engaging in a successful release review (with corresponding super-majority approval from the specification committee).
* Read more about [release reviews](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-reviews-release) in the EFSP.

### Steps Involved

1. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[release review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md)**.
2. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a release review.
3. Wait for a successful release review before proceeding with the release.

## Service Release {#service}

* There is no formal release review required for a Specification service release (x.y.z) as long as the JESP definition of a “service release” is adhered to.
* That means that no functionality changes or increase in IP scope are permitted in a service release. 
* Read more about [service releases](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-releases-service) in the EFSP as well as in the [JESP](https://jakarta.ee/about/jesp/).

### Steps Involved

1. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[service release template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/service_release_pr_template.md)**.
2. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to announce that the PR is ready for review.
3. Wait for the PR approval and merge before proceeding.

## Progress Review {#progress}

![Progress Review](JESP_progress-review.png)

* Progress reviews are not part of the normal flow of the JESP: *creation->plan->release->plan->release->plan->release* and so on.
* A progress review can be initiated by the project when they want to inform the specification committee about their progress, but are not ready for a release yet.
* A progress review may be requested by the specification committee if no progress has been made in 12 months.
* Read more about [progress reviews](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-reviews-progress) in the EFSP.

### Steps Involved

1. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[progress review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/progress_review_pr_template.md)**.
2. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a plan review.
3. Wait for a successful progress review before proceeding.
