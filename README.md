### How to include a new membership testimonials
* Website https://jakarta.ee/membership/ rotates a series of membership testimonials.
* Each testimonial is around 400 characters long.
* To add a new quote, a Github issue and Pull-Request can be sent to https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee repository.
* Pull-request should contains a new `.yml` file in the folder `data/membership/testimonials/` with the folling format:
    ```
    testimonial: "testimonial text no longer than 450 characters"
    title: "<Author of the testimonial> , <Organization>"
    ```
* Example of [PR](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakarta.ee/pull/1097/files )

### How to include a new entry in https://jakarta.ee/news/ section

* Create a new folder under `jakarta.ee/content/news`, the folder's name will become part of the final URL for the new entry.
* Create a file named `_index.md`. This will hold the main entry content for the URL defined in the previous step.
* Add an image `banner.png` to be used as the main card for the new entry defined in the file from previous step.

Final structure for a new News entry should look like this:
```
├── content
│   ├── news
│   │   ├── new-entry-name
│   │   │   ├── _index.md
│   │   │   └── banner.png
```

`_index.md` has two main sections: `Header` and `Content`
The `header` provide metadata needed for the new entry to be published in the list from https://jakarta.ee/news/

```
---
title: "New entry title"
date: "2021-06-30"
publishDate: "2021-04-01"
type: "announcement"
news/tags:
  - "Jakarta EE"
  - "Release"
authors: [{gh_handle: "shabnammayel", name: "Shabnam Mmayel"}, {gh_handle: "TanjaObradovic", name: "Tanja Obradovic"}]
image: "./banner.png"
summary: "Summary text to be presented in the news index page"
---
```

**Important**

- `publishDate` is needed for the new entry to appear in the `https://jakarta.ee/news/` list if the `date` is set in the future.
- For the correct list of `type` and `news/tags`, review previous entries before creating a new one.
- `authors` section receive a list of Github Handles and names, this is used to populate images and authors name automatically in the entry.

The rest of the `_index.md` needs general markdown format to populate the new entry content. 

Eclipse Foundation Marketing Manager is responsible for approving the new entry (via pull request) for the `https://jakarta.ee/news/` section.


### How to include a new entry in https://jakarta.ee/blogs section

* Add images to be used in the content of the new entry.

│   │   ├── new-entry-name
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   │   └── image.jpg
│   │   │   ├── index.md
