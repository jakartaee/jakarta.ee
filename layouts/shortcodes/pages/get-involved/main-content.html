                    <p>Select a <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j">Jakarta EE project of interest</a>, join the project&rsquo;s mailing list and start communicating with the team.</p>

                    <p>Before starting to contribute, you need to make sure your paperwork is in order. When contributing as an individual, login to your EF account and sign the 
                        Eclipse Contributor Agreement. You can then work with the project team to contribute your work. Visit the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php">Eclipse 
                        Contributor Agreement</a> page to learn more about the agreement. However, in the case your employer is already a member of the Jakarta EE Working Group, 
                        your employer has a <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreement.pdf">Member Committer and Contributor 
                        Agreement</a> in place that covers all their employees who are contributing, and you do not need to do anything!</p>

                    <p>Jakarta EE contributors are eligible to become committers. Becoming a committer can happen in a couple of ways: 1) For existing 
                        Jakarta EE projects, it happens through an election! After you have made contributions that demonstrate that you understand 
                        how the open source project works, a current committer on that project will initiate an election. Current committers must vote 
                        in the election; so creating a public record of high quality contributions that committers (and the community) can review is 
                        the most important part of this entire process. 2) Another option is to become a committer of a new Jakarta EE Specification 
                        project, by making initial contributions. The corresponding Project Management Committee (PMC) of the project nominates an 
                        initial set of committers for approval by the Executive Director (or his delegates).</p>

                    <p>If your employer is a member of the Jakarta EE Working Group, they&rsquo;ve already signed the necessary paperwork and there is no paperwork for you to complete.</p>

                    <p>If your employer is not a member of the Jakarta EE Working Group, you will need to complete the following forms:</p>
